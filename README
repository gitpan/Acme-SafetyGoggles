Acme-SafetyGoggles

Is some module you imported using source filtering? If the
answer is yes, or if the answer is "I don't know", then
you can't trust the code in front of your own eyes! 

That's why you should always use patent-pending 
Acme::SafetyGoggles in your untrusted Perl code! 
Acme::SafetyGoggles  compares your original source file
with the code that is actually going to be run, and
alerts you to any differences. 

Protect the programmer's seventh most important
attribute --  his/her eyes -- with the Acme::SafetyGoggles
module.
